# ProjectGreen
App "PLANET GREEN" works in a simple manner, first the contractors and construction companies must input some of their details into the app, this will generate a unique id. This, Id is then entered and
       will give the users 4 locations in which they have to transplant the existing trees in their construction sites to the specifies locations. Once, GHMC has verified whether the trees have been planted or not, if 
       all the details are verified the permission will be given to continue with the construction. Our app "PLANET GREEN" will be available in all operating systems and it is also available in mee seva for people      
       who don’t have access to internet. Our app also helps in creating employment opportunities for the unemployed, as managing an app and data of this magnitude requires a substantial number of employees.
       While a private organization may have better servers and other facilities, there is no guarantee that the location data can be safe, and while they will ensure that the app will work in many languages, there is
       no guarantee, that they will cover every local and minor language’s is best for our app to be handed over to the GHMC, as they have all the data necessary for the app to function, and they will ensure that
       the app is available in all the local languages.
